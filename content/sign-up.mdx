## Suggested donations

We offer means-based suggested donations for the festival:

* EARLY BIRD (until 31/3): - £90 (*By paying a refundable deposit of £30 before 31/3 you can secure this pricing)*
* Community support donation - £130 (*By choosing this ticket, you’re helping someone else attend. It supports our low-income and accessibility fund*)
* Standard donation - £110 (*This tier covers your place and keeps the event going for the whole community*)
* Solidarity donation - £70 (*This ticket is for anyone who needs financial support*)

T﻿his year we are running a deposit scheme where you can secure your ticket for £30 and pay the rest by 1st July.

The donation covers site hire, an amazing sound system, mind blowing installations and one delicious meal each day of the festival.

We don't ever make any profit on this and any leftover money goes into making next year even better!

We hope not to exclude anyone for financial reasons, so if you really can't afford either suggested donation get in touch.
