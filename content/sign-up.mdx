## Suggested donations

We offer means-based suggested donations for the festival:

* £﻿140 Standard
* £80 Reduced (student/low income)

T﻿his year we are running a deposit scheme where you can secure your ticket for £30 and pay the rest by 1st July.

The donation covers site hire, an amazing sound system, mind blowing installations and one delicious meal each day of the festival.

We don't ever make any profit on this and any leftover money goes into making next year even better!

We hope not to exclude anyone for financial reasons, so if you really can't afford either suggested donation get in touch.
