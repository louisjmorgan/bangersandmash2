## Suggested donations

We offer means-based suggested donations for the festival:

- £100 standard donation
- £70 income/student donation

The donation covers site hire, an amazing sound system, mind blowing installations and one delicious meal each day of the festival.

We don't ever make any profit on this and any leftover money goes into making next year even better!

We hope not to exclude anyone for financial reasons, so if you really can't afford either suggested donation get in touch.
