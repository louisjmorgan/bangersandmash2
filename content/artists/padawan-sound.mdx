Leeds based DJ Padawan Sound has spent almost 15 years garnering a reputation for his eclectic sets and tight mixing skills. On the dancefloor, he has been known to favour percussive polyrhythms across a range of tempos, often anchored by moods and frequencies that give a nod to his early infatuation with the UK Dubstep scene. As the founder of the northâ€™s premiere Ambient party, Think Tank, he has never been afraid to approach his sets with a sense of patience and narrative contemplation, often eschewing the big drops in favour of crafting a sustained emotional catharsis. Whether in the dance or after it, Padawan Sound will reward your attention
