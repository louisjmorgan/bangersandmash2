Brighton-based jungle aficionado Josie Bee is a part of the new wave of modern musicians aiming to bring back an old-school flavour to the dance music world. Gliding atmospheric pads, intense 808-style sub bass, and chopped-up drum breaks are commonly on the menu in her productions, with her DJ sets featuring both the minimalistic and ethereal, and the more intense, amen-laden ends of the jungle and hardcore spectrum in equal measure.
