## Stages

We have 10/10 custom built audiophile quality sound systems that’ll make Funktion-One seem like your nan's vacuum cleaner. A chill-out space with 24/7 comfy beats and ambient wabs is also on offer for those who need a break from the chaos.

## Get involved!

The music you bring is the music that gets played so load up those USBs. We’re never short of talented DJs filling the dancefloor and welcome everyone from the seasoned professional to those who have never DJ’d before and want to give it a go! We encourage everyone who’s got some music they want to share to jump on the decks - there will be plenty of people on hand to help out if you’re inexperienced. This year as a new addition we’ll be opening up a Jam Space, so bring your best instruments and voice-boxes. We can do a little concert!

Organisation is loose, once we’ve kicked off we put a board for you to sign up with your name, type of music you’ll be playin, and whether you’d like any technical help. We pull together a cohesive, fluid line up when we’re on site.

## Prepare your ears

Our music tastes are pretty diverse from the most melodious of house and the crunchiest of industrial techno to the hardest, silliest bangers you’ve ever heard. Basically fun, lip-smacking dance music to party to. Staying up past your bedtime is thoroughly encouraged.

**Here's a taster of various sets from over the years!**
