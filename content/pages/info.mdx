### Getting There

T﻿O UPDATE

### What to bring?

**Tent and camping stuff** - while there are some buildings on site, these will be reserved for cooking/activities. Everyone is expected to bring a tent/van/other portable dwelling they can sleep in.

**Cutlery and plates** - we will not be providing these for the communal meal so bring your own to avoid waiting for other people to finish!

**Seating** - A camping chair if you have it and hammocks for our new hammock zone.

**Food** - For lunch and breakfast. We will provide a tasty vegan dinner!

**Drinks** - For yourself and to share!

**Wavy garms** - Obviously.

**Wacky gizmos** - lights, decor, instruments, you name it.

**Music stuff** - relevant cables, headphones, usbs, records, wax cylinders, fossilized megalodon mating calls.

**Cash** - People might be selling things and won't accept card.

### Wellbeing

Wellbeing is a very important part of Bangers, and we will have someone on-hand at all times to make sure everyone is partying safely, enjoying themselves and feeling good. Please let us know immediately if something is wrong and we will sort it out.

### Timings

The first couple of days is setup which is accompanied by some warm up partying and the last day is packdown with some good vibe packdown tunes. If you want to come and help set up then that’s great! If you just wanna do the partying then you can get the best of it by being there Friday-Monday. Packdown is usually quite fun too with lots of friendly faces still majorly buzzing from the fun we’ve had.
