## Location

We will be celebrating Bangers & Mashtival’s 9th anniversary by transforming the grounds of Muncaster Castle into a festival playground. Muncaster is located in the heart of the Western Lake District close to Ravenglass, an old Roman port and the only coastal village in the Lake District National Park. 

## Getting There

Driving: put the postcode CA18 1RD into your route planner and that will guide you to the site, then follow signs to the Bangers & Mashtival car park. 

T﻿rain: Ravenglass train station is about 20-30 minutes walk from Muncaster. There are no taxi ranks so taxis should be pre-booked. You can try Gosforth Taxis on 01946725308.

## What to bring?

**Tent and camping stuff** - while there are some buildings on site, these will be reserved for cooking/activities. Everyone is expected to bring a tent/van/other portable dwelling they can sleep in.

**Cutlery and plates** - we will not be providing these for the communal meal so bring your own to avoid waiting for other people to finish!

**Seating** - if you have one, camping chairs always come in handy..

**Food** - we will provide a tasty veggie dinner but please bring food for breakfast and lunch!

**Drinks** - for yourself and to share!

**Wavy garms** - obviously.

**Wacky gizmos** - lights, decor, instruments, you name it. 

**Music stuff** - relevant cables, headphones, usbs, records, wax cylinders, fossilized megalodon mating calls.

**Cash** - people might be selling things and won't accept card.

## Wellbeing

Wellbeing is a very important part of Bangers, and we will have someone on-hand at all times to make sure everyone is partying safely, enjoying themselves and feeling good. Please let us know immediately if something is wrong and we will sort it out.

## Timings

The first couple of days is setup which is accompanied by some warm up partying and the last day is packdown with some good vibe packdown tunes. If you want to come and help set up then that’s great! If you just wanna do the partying then you can get the best of it by being there Friday-Monday. Packdown is usually quite fun too with lots of friendly faces still majorly buzzing from the fun we’ve had.
