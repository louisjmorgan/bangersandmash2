## Hungry?

Fresh tasty grub is provided as part of the package in a communal (veggie) meal each evening that’ll set you up nicely for the night's antics. We will cater to all dietary requirements - let us know what your needs are and we’ll sort it. We encourage you to bring your own food supplies for the rest of the day.

If you’d like to cook for the troops one day please get in touch you will receive all the praise and admiration.
