# S﻿tages

We have 10/10 custom built audiophile quality sound systems that’ll make Funktion-One seem like your nan's vacuum cleaner. A chill-out space with 24/7 comfy beats and ambient wabs is also on offer for those who need a break from the chaos.

## P﻿repare your ears

Our music tastes are pretty diverse from the most melodious of house and the crunchiest of industrial techno to the hardest, silliest bangers you’ve ever heard. Basically fun, lip-smacking dance music to party to. Staying up past your bedtime is thoroughly encouraged.

#### Here's a taster of various sets from over the years

## G﻿et involved!

The music you bring is the music that gets played so load up those USBs. We’re never short of talented DJs filling the dancefloor and welcome everyone from the seasoned professional to those who have never DJ’d before and want to give it a go! We encourage everyone who’s got some music they want to share to jump on the decks - there will be plenty of people on hand to help out if you’re inexperienced. This year as a new addition we’ll be opening up a Jam Space, so bring your best instruments and voice-boxes. We can do a little concert!

Organisation is loose, once we’ve kicked off we put a board for you to sign up with your name, type of music you’ll be playin, and whether you’d like any technical help. We pull together a cohesive, fluid line up when we’re on site.

## A﻿rtists

#### Josie Bee

Brighton-based jungle aficionado Josie Bee is a part of the new wave of modern musicians aiming to bring back an old-school flavour to the dance music world. Gliding atmospheric pads, intense 808-style sub bass, and chopped-up drum breaks are commonly on the menu in her productions, with her DJ sets featuring both the minimalistic and ethereal, and the more intense, amen-laden ends of the jungle and hardcore spectrum in equal measure.

#### Padawan Sound

Leeds based DJ Padawan Sound has spent almost 15 years garnering a reputation for his eclectic sets and tight mixing skills. On the dancefloor, he has been known to favour percussive polyrhythms across a range of tempos, often anchored by moods and frequencies that give a nod to his early infatuation with the UK Dubstep scene. As the founder of the north’s premiere Ambient party, Think Tank, he has never been afraid to approach his sets with a sense of patience and narrative contemplation, often eschewing the big drops in favour of crafting a sustained emotional catharsis. Whether in the dance or after it, Padawan Sound will reward your attention.

#### Vivi

Ultimately it's all just wobbly air... Fascinated by the contrast between brighter and darker elements, Vivi's sets weave ephemeral harmonies onto a frame of relentless hypnotic rhythms. Music to keep your feet thinking and your mind dancing.
