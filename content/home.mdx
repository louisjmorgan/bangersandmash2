## What is Bangers & Mashtival?

A DIY micro-festival dedicated to celebrating all of your quirks, peculiarities and out-of-the-box qualities. 

We provide the support for YOU to dream big, spin stories, make things happen, and party with a sound group of individuals. We provide the space, materials, and gizmos needed for art and music, as well as plenty of activities, games, crafts & toys for you to get silly with. 

The Bangers “DIY Ethos” has always been about participation, and we encourage you to get involved, get dancing, get crafty, play music, create something bizarre, and frolic freely!

## 30th August - 6th September 2023

We will be celebrating Bangers & Mashtival’s 9th anniversary by transforming the grounds of Muncaster Castle into a festival playground. The festival runs for a week b﻿ut you can come along for a﻿s many days as you want.
